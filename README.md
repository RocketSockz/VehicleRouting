# Vehicle Routing Problem 

Hello hello, welcome to the repo. 

## Setup

This repository assumes that you have the LTS (20.16.0) version of node.js installed on your machine. 

For initial installation - please refer to the [Official Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Tools Used

For the building of this project here are all of the resources I used
1) a lot of the API search was done on the [Node.js reference page](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v20.x/api/index.html).
2) Regular Expressions were written using google, and https://regex101.com/
3) A [random article about Math](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/fundamental/javascript-fundamental-exercise-243.php) - so I was 100% sure Math.hypot was the same as Euclidean distance.
